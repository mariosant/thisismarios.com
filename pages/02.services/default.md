# My services at your disposal

Would you like to build your company's website? How about launch an full blown digital product? Maybe provide an easy to use API for integrating third party applications with yours? I can help you do that.

My skills are available to you, as a solo developer or being part of your team.

Roughly speaking, they break to following 3 kind of tasks.

## Easy to use websites that convert

Websites should be easy to use and most important, they must convert your visitors into buying customers. I can help you create your next website, either you are a thriving solo (like me) business owner, either you are representing a medium sized company.

We are going to talk about your business goals and strategy and design a process, what your website should offer and how it should work. I will then design and build it, using _state of the art_ technology. Finally, I will **deliver a working product** to a blazing fast and secure hosting environment.

Did I mention that you will be the owner of the final source code? How about that you are going to be able to host it anywhere you prefer?
Exactly, you are in good hands!

## Immersive real-time web applications

World wide web is changing fast. Your data is too. Your product application should be able to react whenever data changes, and fast!

I can help you build a digital product that will react to data changes and will update it's state in realtime.

Every aspect of your application will be taken care of. I am going to deliver:

- A clean linted codebase hosted to Github.
- Immersive user experience with hand-crafted UI and all things users love.
- Integrated end-to-end tests to make sure that the app is always working the way it should.
- Heroku based hosting, making sure that your app is scalable.

Once again, you will be the owner of the final source code and yes, you will be able to host your product anywhere you prefer.

## Custom development

Perhaps you need transactional emails setup.
Or you need a Google Chrome extension.
Maybe integrate to your CRM.
Or an API to provide data endpoints.

Do these sound gibberish? Good, that's where I get involved.

I am always available to discuss your needs. I can help you choose the right technology and give you my opinion - for free.
